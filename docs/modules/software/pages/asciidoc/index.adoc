== Using text formatting in code blocks
Sometimes I want to use bold or italics inside of a code block to represent
something that you can't copy/paste. For example:
[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
nvm use *_<major_version>_*
----

Since the user has to say which major version they want, I'd like to draw
attention to that using an approach similar to what I see in many books.

To accomplish this, Asciidoc provides the ability to customize the substitutions
applied in a block.

We use a listing block for source code, so add this just above the block:
----
[subs="+quotes"]
----

This will allow you to use the standard text formatting in the block:
----
nvm use *_<major_version>_*
----

which will render as:
[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
nvm use *_<major_version>_*
----
